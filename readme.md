## Petalia

Live site: https://petalia-flowershop-05fb6f37adca.herokuapp.com/

The Petalia Flower Shop app was created to provide a seamless, user-friendly platform for customers to explore and purchase floral arrangements online. With the increasing trend of e-commerce and the growing demand for personalized shopping experiences, the app aims to make flower shopping convenient, accessible, and enjoyable for all users.

Key motivations for developing Petalia Flower Shop include:

Accessibility: Traditional flower shops often have limited operating hours and inventory visibility. This app allows users to shop for flowers anytime and view available arrangements in real time.

Convenience: Busy lifestyles can make it difficult for customers to visit physical stores. The app offers a streamlined browsing and purchasing process, ensuring users can select and order flowers in just a few clicks.

Customization: Flowers are often purchased for special occasions or as gifts, requiring unique arrangements. Petalia includes features that allow users to personalize their orders, enhancing the customer experience.

Aesthetic Appeal: As a flower shop, showcasing the beauty of the products is crucial. The app was designed with a clean and visually appealing interface to highlight the vibrancy and elegance of the floral arrangements.

Scalability: Petalia serves as a scalable solution for small and medium-sized florists looking to expand their reach online without requiring a significant investment in standalone e-commerce infrastructure.

Sustainability and Growth: By digitizing the flower shopping process, Petalia not only simplifies operations but also provides valuable insights into customer preferences, enabling businesses to adapt and grow.

## UX Design Process

The design of the website was crafted to deliver a seamless, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience tailored for an e-commerce flowershop. Inspiration was drawn from platforms like Pinterest and Dribbble, where I explored modern floral design layouts, color palettes, and UI components that resonate with elegance and simplicity.

To ensure the website met user expectations, I considered:

- Target Audience: Individuals looking for flower arrangements for special occasions, gifts, or wedding bouquets.
- User Needs: Simple navigation, easy product discovery, and smooth checkout process.
- Pain Points: Poor mobile responsiveness, cluttered designs, and complex user flows seen in similar sites. I decided to go with something more simple, but at the same time keep the floral design.

### Wireframes and Mock-ups 

For this project, I've used tools like Figma for developing the wireframes for:

-Homepage (Hero section, call-to-action, product highlights)
-Product Listing Page (clear card layouts, sorting)
-Checkout and Sign-Up Forms (minimalistic and modern design) These wireframes served as blueprints to -maintain clarity and consistency during development.

Later in the project, I decided to change the hero image and background and design a new one in Canva.


Color Palette: Soft pastel tones, including lavender and pale pink, were chosen to inspire a flower-inspired theme.

Imagery: High-quality images of bouquets and floral arrangements were prioritized to enhance the aesthetic appeal and highlight the product offerings. Some of the bouquets were generated with AI as I struggled to find the (free) images I needed for my products.

### Bugs 


## Challenges encountered
Once challenging milestone in my project was setting up the AWS bucket for statics. The issue here was mainly with the products as it took me a while to notice that when uploading a product using admin, it was changing the actual name of the file, making it different than what I had in the bucket. So with every product uploaded, I would have one name in admin, then one name in my bucket, both different than what I've uploaded. I have't found the cause, but I've manually changed that to make sure my product image is displaying correctly.


## Automated Tests

This project includes automated tests to ensure the correct functionality of the **checkout page** and **Stripe integration**. The tests cover both frontend and backend components, including the Stripe payment processing logic.

The test suite uses Django's built-in testing framework (`django.test`) and covers the following areas:

- **Checkout Page**: Verifies that the checkout page renders correctly.
- **Stripe Integration**: Ensures the correct Stripe keys are being used, and that API calls to Stripe are functional.

### Checkout Page Tests

The `CheckoutViewsTestCase` class tests the **checkout page** rendering.

#### Test: `test_checkout_page_loads`
Verifies that the checkout page:
- Returns a status code of `200` (OK).
- Uses the correct template (`checkout/checkout.html`).

### Stripe Integration Tests

The `StripeIntegrationTest` class ensures that the integration with Stripe works as expected, including validating the **public** and **secret keys**.

#### Test: `test_stripe_secret_key_valid`
Validates the **secret key** by making a `PaymentIntent` API call to Stripe. It checks:
- The request successfully creates a `PaymentIntent` with the correct amount and currency.
- If authentication fails, the test raises an `AuthenticationError`.

#### Test: `test_stripe_public_key_valid`
Checks if the **public key** is valid by simulating the creation of a `PaymentIntent` on the frontend. It verifies that the public key starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_` as expected for Stripe keys.

#### Test: `test_stripe_keys_integrated`
Combines `test_stripe_secret_key_valid` and `test_stripe_public_key_valid` to ensure both keys are properly integrated.

#### Test: `test_invalid_public_key`
Verifies that an invalid **public key** results in a `StripeError` when attempting to create a `PaymentIntent`.

### Validators

- WS3 HTML Testing Validator https://validator.w3.org/
Since the project was built using Django, the validator returned several errors and warnings that are specific to the templating system and Djangoâ€™s dynamic content rendering. These errors do not indicate actual issues with the HTML but rather limitations of the validator when working with frameworks like Django.

- CSS After testing the CSS code with Jigsaw Validator, there were no errors found.
- 

### Stripe Elements Tests

The Stripe Elements tests ensure the correct behavior of the **Stripe Elements** integration:

- **Stripe Initialization**: Ensures that the Stripe object is correctly initialized with the public key from the backend (Django).
- **Element Creation**: Validates that the `card` element is created using the mocked `elements.create` method.
- **Element Mounting**: Confirms that the `mount` function is called with the correct DOM element (`#card-element`), simulating the mounting of the payment form.

### Mocking Stripe API

Since Jest runs in a Node.js environment and cannot interact with the actual Stripe API or load static files like `stripe_elements.js`, the **Stripe API** is **mocked** using Jest's mock functions. This allows us to simulate Stripe Elements' behavior and test the integration logic without making real API calls or loading external resources.

## Manual Tests

1. 6. UI/UX Testing
Verified all links and navigation paths to ensure they redirect to the correct pages without broken links or errors.
Tested navigation menus, footer links, and any embedded hyperlinks to confirm consistency.
Gathered feedback from friends on the ease of navigation, the intuitiveness of the UI, and the clarity of messages.
Ensured error messages were helpful and guided users to correct mistakes.

2. Checking responsiveness in  Developer Tools

Used Developer Tools in Chrome to simulate various screen sizes.
Ensured the site layout adapts correctly for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen resolutions.
Confirmed buttons, text, images, and other UI elements adjust and remain legible on smaller screens.

3. Adding products to the card

Added individual and multiple products to the shopping cart.
Verified quantities and prices update accurately.
Checked the cart functionality persists between sessions using cookies or server-side storage.
Validated product removal works as expected.

4. Placing an order
One issue encountered when placing an order was that it didn't return checkout_success everytime an order was placed. When opening with Dev Tools, it did work on mobile but not on desktop. Also, the grand total was not being returned on the checkout success page. 

5. Viewing the app on different mobile devices 
Tested the site on a range of physical devices (IPhone 14, Android phones such as Samsung S24, S20, iPad).


### Future Features 

1. User Wishlist - where the user can save their favourite products.
2. Seasonal Promotions with countdown timers for ongoing deals.
3. AI-Powered Chatbot that provides instant assistance to customers based on a limited number of questions they might ask.
